Hello there! I'm Enrique, and I'm all about web development, especially when it comes to JavaScript.

JavaScript is my go-to language for bringing ideas to life on the web. Whether I'm working on frontend interfaces or backend functionality with Node.js, there's something about JavaScript that just clicks for me. I enjoy exploring its versatility and finding practical solutions to real-world problems using frameworks like React and Vue.js.

In addition to web development, I've spent several years dedicated to the world of Business Intelligence (BI). Within this domain, I've assisted users in crafting custom solutions tailored to their needs, leveraging SDKs and APIs to unlock the full potential of their data. Whether it's building interactive dashboards, automating reports, or integrating BI tools into existing systems, I've honed my skills in turning data into actionable insights that drive business growth.

Currently, my focus lies in assisting developers with building custom solutions for user management, authentication, and authorization. Whether it's implementing role-based access control, integrating with identity providers, or enhancing security through multi-factor authentication, I work closely with developers to ensure that their applications have robust and user-friendly authentication systems in place. My goal is to empower developers to create seamless and secure user experiences that instill trust and confidence in their applications.

I'm creating this website to document all the things I'm learning while having fun experimenting with web development. It's a space where I can share insights, tutorials, and projects that showcase my passion for JavaScript and other aspects of web development. For example, I've recently built this site using a Static Site Generator (SSG) called 11ty, and I'm excited to continue exploring new technologies and sharing my experiences along the way.
